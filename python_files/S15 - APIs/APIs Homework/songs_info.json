Audie Award Winner for Non-Fiction, Abridged<\/b><br \/><br \/>Even before the Beatles hit the big time, a myth was created. This version of the Beatles legend smoothed the rough edges and filled in the fault lines, and for more than forty years this manicured version of the Beatles story has sustained as truth -- until now.<br \/> The product of almost a decade of research, hundreds of unprecedented interviews, and the discovery of scores of never-before-revealed documents, Bob Spitz's <i>The Beatles<\/i> is the biography fans have been waiting for.<br \/> Never before has a biography of musicians been so immersive and textured. We are there in the McCartney living room when Paul and John learn to write songs together; backstage the night Ringo takes over on drums; in seedy German strip clubs where George lies about his age so the band can perform; and at the <i>Ed Sullivan Show<\/i> as America discovers the joy and the madness. From Shea to San Francisco, through the London night, on to India, through marmalade skies, across the universe-all the way to a rooftop concert and one last moment of laughter and music.<br \/> It is all here, the highs and the lows, the love and the rivalry, the drugs, the tears, the thrill, the magic never again to be repeated. Bob Spitz's masterpiece is, at long last, the biography the Beatles deserve.","1":"The most successful entity in the history of the entertainment business, and still as popular as ever forty years on, The Beatles' story is a classic rags to riches tale. Here, every official Beatles single and album is discussed, along with a detailed discussion of how the four working-class Liverpool lads met and, using the songs and records as signposts, a journey through their colourful, historic and celebrated career.","2":"<i>Ticket to Ride<\/i> recounts broadcast journalist Larry Kane's travels with the Beatles during their first North American tour. The book provides an intimate look at the Fab Four and contains original interview recordings with the band conducted during the tour.","3":"This worldwide bestseller is the biography that defined a band\u2014and an era.<br \/><br \/>As the friend and only authorized biographer of the most famous musical group in history, Davies had full access to the Beatles\u2014including their family, friends, and colleauges\u2014as well as their help and encouragement in writing this biography. He spent eighteen months with them when they were at the peak of their musical genius and the pinnacle of their popularity, making a mark on history and popular culture that would never fade. Davies stayed on with the Beatles through their breakup and remained friends with the individual members afterwards, enabling him to write the continuing story of their solo careers.<br \/><br \/>First published in 1968, this newly revised edition has added information, including a new introduction and a newly discovered song lyric by George Harrison.","4":"Here is the Beatles' incredible story in their own words!

Mark Lewisohn uses his unprecedented archival access and hundreds of new interviews to construct the full story of the lives and work of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. <br \/><br \/>Ten years in the making, <i>Tune In<\/i> takes the Beatles from before their childhoods through the final hour of 1962\u2014when, with breakthrough success just days away, they stand on the cusp of a whole new kind of fame and celebrity. They\u2019ve one hit record (\"Love Me Do\") behind them and the next (\"Please Please Me\") primed for release, their first album session is booked, and America is clear on the horizon. &#xa0;This is the lesser-known Beatles story\u2014the pre-Fab years of Liverpool and Hamburg\u2014and in many respects the most absorbing and incredible period of them all. Here is the complete and true account of their family lives, childhoods, teenage years and their infatuation with American music, here is the riveting narrative of their unforgettable days and nights in the Cavern Club, their laughs, larks and adventures when they could move about freely, before fame closed in. &#xa0;<br \/><br \/>For those who\u2019ve never read a Beatles book before, this is the place to discover the young men behind the icons. For those who think they know John, Paul, George, and Ringo, it\u2019s time to press the Reset button and tune into the real story, the lasting word.","8":"Often overlooked as a songwriter, despite penning The Beatles' standards \"Something\" and \"Here Comes the Sun\", and being the first of the four to release solo material, George Harrison embraced fame reluctantly, retiring from public life after the assassination of John Lennon. Launching a spectacular late-1980s comeback with The Traveling Wilburys, he returned as a household name for a new generation with the Anthology projects and 2000's best-selling <i>1<\/i> album.<br \/>This abridged version of <i>George Harrison<\/i> chronicles the life of  \"the quiet one\" right up to his recent unsuccessful battle with cancer.","9":"<b>This program is read by the author.<br \/><br \/>A legendary record producer and performer takes listeners on an alphabetical journey of insights into the music of the Beatles and individual reminiscences of John, Paul, George, and Ringo.<\/b><br \/><br \/>Peter Asher met the Beatles in the spring of 1963, the start of a lifelong association with the band and its members. He had a front-row seat as they elevated pop music into an art form, and he was present at the creation of some of the most iconic music of our times.<br \/><br \/>But Asher was also a talented musician in his own right, with a great ear for what was new and fresh. Once, when Paul McCartney wrote a song that John Lennon didn\u2019t think was right for the Beatles, Asher asked if he could record it. \u201cA World Without Love\u201d became a global number-one hit for his duo, Peter and Gordon. A few years later Asher was asked by Paul McCartney to help start Apple Records and the first artist Asher discovered and signed up was a young American singer-songwriter named James Taylor. Before long he would be not only managing and producing Taylor but also (having left Apple and moved to Los Angeles) working with Linda Ronstadt, Neil Diamond, Robin Williams, Joni Mitchell and Cher, among others. <br \/><br \/><i>In The Beatles from A to Zed<\/i>, based upon twenty-six episodes of his current and highly popular radio show \u201cFrom Me to You\u201d on the Beatles Channel of SiriusXM, Peter Asher shares his memories and insights about the Fab Four, weaving his reflections into a whimsical alphabetical journey that focuses not only on songs whose titles start with each letter, but also on recurrent themes in the Beatles\u2019 music, the instruments they played, the innovations they pioneered, the artists who influenced them, the key people in their lives, and the cultural events of the time."},"copyright":{"0":null,"1":"\u00a9 2016 Summersdale Publishing","2":"\u00a9 2007 DLO Records","3":"\u00a9 2010 Blackstone Audio","4":"\u00a9 2019 Author's Republic","5":"\u00a9 2019 Author's Republic","6":"\u00a9 2019 Author's Republic","7":null,"8":"\u00a9 2007 Music Sales Corporation","9":null},"amgArtistId":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":170505.0,"9":null},"kind":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null},"trackId":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null},"trackName":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null},"trackCensoredName":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null},"trackViewUrl":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null},"artworkUrl30":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null},"trackPrice":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null},"trackExplicitness":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null},"discCount":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null},"discNumber":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null},"trackNumber":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null},"trackTimeMillis":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null},"isStreamable":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null},"contentAdvisoryRating":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null},"collectionArtistName":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null},"collectionArtistId":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null}}
